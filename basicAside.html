<body>

You are not limited to a single <nav> element in your documents, which is good for site developers who create templates that include both primary and secondary navigation. For example, you might see horizontal primary navigation at the top of a page (often contained within a <header> element) and then vertical navigation in the left column of a page, representing the secondary pages within the main section. In that case, you simply use a second <nav> element, not contained within the <header>, placed and styled differently to delineate the two types visually in addition to semantically.

    Remember that the <nav> element is used for major navigational content; primary and secondary navigation both count, as does the inclusion of tables of contents within a page. For good and useful semantic use of the <nav> element, do not simply apply it to every link that allows a user to navigate anywhere. Note that we said “good and useful” semantic use, not necessarily “valid” use; it’s true that you could apply <nav> to any list of links, and it would be valid according to the HTML specification because links are flow content. But it wouldn’t be particularly useful to surround a list of links to social media sharing tools with the <nav> element as it wouldn’t add accurate or useful meaning.

        When to Use <aside>
            As you’ll have guessed based on the number of notes and sidebars in these lessons, we’re big fans of the type of content that is most appropriately marked up within the <aside> element. The <aside> element is meant to contain any content that is tangentially related to the content around it—additional explanation, links to related resources, pull quotes, helper text, and so on. You might think of the <aside> element as a sidebar, but be careful not to think of it only as a visual sidebar or a column on the side of a page where you can stick anything and everything you want, whether or not it’s related to the content or site at hand.

            In Figure 2.8, you can see how content in an <aside> is used to create a pull quote, or a content excerpt that is specifically set aside to call attention to it. The <aside>, in this case, is used to highlight an important section of the text, but it could also be used to define a term or link to related documents.
